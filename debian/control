Description: solving sparse linear systems - runtime files
 ShyLU is a package for solving sparse linear systems. It can be used either as

 preconditioner. ShyLU uses a hybrid direct/iterative approach based on Schur
 complements. The goal is to provide robustness similar to sparse direct
 solvers, but memory usage more similar to preconditioned iterative solvers.
 ShyLU was designed as a node-level solver. It can use both MPI and threads in
 several ways. ShyLU was designed (a) to solve difficult but medium-size
 problems, and (b) to be used as a subdomain solver or smoother for very large
 problems within an iterative scheme. It is a purely algebraic method so can be
 used as a black-box solver. ShyLU has been particularly successful in
 electrical circuit simulation (Xyce).

 mirrors that of Tpetra. Xpetra enables algorithm developers to write to a
 single interface but be able to use either Epetra or Tpetra. Xpetra can also be
 introduced into existing code to allow for gradual migration.
 .
 This package contains the dynamic libraries.

Description: object-oriented framework for large-scale problems - documentation
 The Trilinos Project is an effort to develop algorithms and enabling
 technologies within an object-oriented software framework for the
 solution of large-scale, complex multi-physics engineering and
 scientific problems. A unique design feature of Trilinos is its
 focus on packages.
 .
 This is documentation for the Trilinos libraries in HTML format.
 Some pages point to header files provided in the corresponding -dev package,
 so it is suggested to install the latter as well.
