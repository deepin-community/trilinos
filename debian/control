 Through the use of template metaprogramming concepts, Phalanx supports
 arbitrary user defined data types and evaluation types. This allows for
 unprecedented flexibility for direct integration with user applications and

Description: solving sparse linear systems - runtime files
 ShyLU is a package for solving sparse linear systems. It can be used either as

 complements. The goal is to provide robustness similar to sparse direct
 solvers, but memory usage more similar to preconditioned iterative solvers.
 ShyLU was designed as a node-level solver. It can use both MPI and threads in
 several ways. ShyLU was designed (a) to solve difficult but medium-size
 problems, and (b) to be used as a subdomain solver or smoother for very large
 problems within an iterative scheme. It is a purely algebraic method so can be
 used as a black-box solver. ShyLU has been particularly successful in

 introduced into existing code to allow for gradual migration.

Description: conversion between Epetra and Teuchos objects - development files
 Xpetra a lightweight wrapper to both Epetra and Tpetra. The Xpetra syntax
 mirrors that of Tpetra. Xpetra enables algorithm developers to write to a
 single interface but be able to use either Epetra or Tpetra. Xpetra can also be
 introduced into existing code to allow for gradual migration.

Description: parallel dynamic load balancing - runtime files
 Zoltan is a toolkit of parallel services for dynamic, unstructured, and/or
 adaptive simulations. Zoltan provides parallel dynamic load balancing and
 related services for a wide variety of applications, including finite element
 methods, matrix operations, particle methods, and crash simulations. Zoltan
 also provides parallel graph coloring, matrix ordering, unstructured
 communication tools, and distributed data directories.

Description: object-oriented framework for large-scale problems - documentation
 The Trilinos Project is an effort to develop algorithms and enabling
 technologies within an object-oriented software framework for the
 solution of large-scale, complex multi-physics engineering and
 scientific problems. A unique design feature of Trilinos is its
 focus on packages.
 .
 This is documentation for the Trilinos libraries in HTML format.
 Some pages point to header files provided in the corresponding -dev package,
 so it is suggested to install the latter as well.
